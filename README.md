<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <br>
<strong>This project is based on online shopping concept. I created a website to sell the mobiles through online. I added here some branded mobile. If anyone want to purchase a mobile, firstly he has to create an account on this. If he has an account on it then he can access his account simply through login page. And if he has no account on it, he has to create an account through signup page. In signup page, some restrictions (such as: email-id pattern, contact number of 10 digits, password pattern, Full name pattern etc.) are applied. So that I can receive the right data of the user. If user write a wrong data, he will get an error message. I connected this form with my database, through which I can store the data of the user.
	If a user wants to know more about E-Store (such as its history, opportunity etc.), he can get information from the about us page. Through this page, user will get more trust on E-Store and can get useful information about E-Store.
	After making of a successful account, the user will be able to buy his interested products. To buy a product, he has to add it into his cart. If he wants to check his product for which he will order, he can easily check it with the help of cart page. Through the cart page, he can easily remove the products and get the total amount. If he wants to purchase his order, then he can simply click on the confirm order button and get a message of successful order. And if he wants to get more products, he can go back after clicking on Click button.
	If a user wants to change his password of his account, he can easily change it through the settings page. After clicking on settings button on navbar, he will go on a page of change password. Here he has to write his old password and new password. After clicking on confirm button, his password will get change and he will move on home page of E-Store website.
	If a user has a query regarding his products, he can go to on contact us page. Through this page he can contact us and can ask his query to us. He has to write his query in message box with his name and email-id and click on submit button. I will get his query in my database.
	In this website, I also added a footer in the bottom, through which user can easily access the information which he wants.</strong>
